        <h1>It's about people</h1>
        Accessibility is not about statistics or guidelines or checklists or money. It is about people who want achieve something. Most of the time it's everyday stuff like making payments, bookings or shopping. But some people are not always able to accomplish these everyday tasks in a straight foreward way. So we have begun making movies about them. They will tell you who they are and what is keeping them from using the web. We hope these will help you to get a better understanding and what you could to to help them accomplish their tasks. 
        This project is still under development and it probably will be be for quite a while. These are only the first few videos of what should become a whole lot more. Please let us know what you think. If you are someone or know someone who has a story to tell that would fit the purpose of this site please get in contact.
        <h1>Who are we</h1>
        We are Johan Huijkman, Katja Hollaar, Rahul Choudhurry, Arend Baarsjes, Tim van Deursen and hopefully a lot more.

        <h1>Accessibility is...</h1>
        <h2>...People</h2>
        <p>trying to do everyday stuff. Making payments and bookings, doing shopping, searching for information, staying up-to-date. When doing these things they are using what we design and build. And more than often it is difficult to use what we created. Because we tend to forget that not everybody is like us.</p>
        <h2>...Usability</h2>
        <p>People interact with the things we create in very different ways. Ways we are not familiar with. And if we don't know our products are being used we surely won't be able to shape them in a way they are usable for everybody</p>
        <h2>...Empathy</h2>
        <p>To help us understand more about our users, our visitors and sometimes even ourselves we have started creating movies about them. These are the first two. But we want to make more. To help us and everybody in our line of business understand what we are talking about when we talk about accessibility: <strong>People</strong>.

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>The idea for this site came to mind after I attended Edge Conf 2014 @ London. There were a lot of questions about Accessibility. And there were a lot of answers. But most of them were technical oriented. How to solve this and how to optimize for that. What seems to be missing in most discussions on accessibillity is the fact that we are talking about humans. We might even be talking about ourselves in a few years from now. Because if you understand the reasons why people are not able to use your products you might see that even you can one day find yourself in a situation where you will not be able to fulfill the simple task at hand. Because someone just plain forgot to optimize for you or the situation you are in.</p>
      <h3>Who?</h3>
      <p>I am Johan Huijkman. Currently I am employed at Q42. I have to thank my employer because he gives me all the space and time I need to build this site. Me and my wonderfull colleagues at Q42 tend to forget about accessibility every now and then. Just like almost everybody else in our line of business. But I hope by creating and sharing these movies I can help make this sort of a collective knowledge so we remember every time for whom we are building our products</p>
