        <h1>What</h1>
        This is empat.io. A site about people. People who want to use your website or app. This site is about empathy and usability. Itâ€™s aim is to provide you with an understanding of the people you are creating your software for.
        <h1>Why</h1>
        Everybody wants to use your website or your app. But not everybody can. Why? Because we tend to forget that not everybody is the same. Not everybody is like us. There are always people who are excluded because they cannot use their hands, their eyes, their ears. Or because they just don't understand what you're saying. And if we don't know who they are then how can we know how they are using our products?
        <h1>How</h1>
        Accessibility is not about statistics or guidelines or checklists or money. It is about live human beings who want to use your software. So we have begun making movies about them. They will tell you who they are and what is keeping them from using your app and what you can do to help them. Here we present the first two. And we intend to make more of them. Please let us know what you think. If you are someone or know someone who has a story to tell that would fit the purpose of this site please get in contact.
        <h1>Who</h1>
        We are Johan Huijkman, Katja Hollaar, Rahul Choudhurry, Arend Baarsjes, Tim van Deursen and any other user.
