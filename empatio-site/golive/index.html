        <h1>It's about people</h1>
        Accessibility is not about statistics or guidelines or checklists or money. It is about people who want achieve something. Most of the time it's everyday stuff like making payments, bookings or shopping. But some people are not always able to accomplish these everyday tasks in a straight foreward way. So we have begun making movies about them. They will tell you who they are and what is keeping them from using the web. We hope these will help you to get a better understanding and what you could to to help them accomplish their tasks. 
        This project is still under development and it probably will be be for quite a while. These are only the first few videos of what should become a whole lot more. Please let us know what you think. If you are someone or know someone who has a story to tell that would fit the purpose of this site please get in contact.
        <h1>Who are we</h1>
        We are Johan Huijkman, Katja Hollaar, Rahul Choudhurry, Arend Baarsjes, Tim van Deursen and hopefully a lot more.
